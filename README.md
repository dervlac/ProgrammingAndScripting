# Programming and Scripting Assessments

This Github contains the final versions of 7 different pieces of code; each code corresponds to a weekly assignment. In addition to these 7 pieces of code, there is also an accompanying functions file, which has been referenced in assignments from week 6 onwards. 


To ensure the smooth operation of all files, it is recommended that the full repository is saved to your machine before attempting to run; in the event of downloading files individually from the repository, you may encounter an error if functions are referenced and the file is not available to be accessed.


The following software is required at a minimum in order to run the code:
' - Python 3.8.x '

The following software have been utilised in the design and amending of the code within this repository, and are recommended as a potential medium from which you can run the code:
 '''
 - Visual Studio Code
 - CMDER
 '''

The aim of the code included within this repository is to show, through the final product, the version history tracked within the repository, and the comments within the code, that an understanding of programming with Pyhton has been obtained throughout the course of this module.

*All files within this repository have been created and updated by Dervla Candon*
